==============

The purpose of this program is to recieve an amount from the user. After recieving said amount, it will determine how many twenties, tens, fives, toonies, loonies, etc. the user will need. You are able to disable certain bills in the event that the user does not have enough.

Something I would like to add is a function to store the amount of bills the user has so that the program will automatically detect when the user does not have enough bills and automatically switch to a different bill.
